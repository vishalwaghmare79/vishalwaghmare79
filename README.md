## ü§ù Collaboration

I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on web development projects, especially those involving frontend technologies like React.js and backend development with Node.js.

## üìö Learning

I‚Äôm currently learning advanced React.js, Redux, and backend technologies like Express and MongoDB.

## üí° Ask Me About

Web development, particularly the MERN stack, and my experience in building practical projects.

## üéâ Fun Facts

1. ‚è∞ I follow the 8-8-8 rule daily: 8 hours of study, 8 hours of sleep, and 8 hours for activities like cooking and gym.  
2. üåÖ I wake up at 6 AM every day, without an alarm!  
3. üìö I prepared for my 12th-grade exams in just 1-2 months and successfully passed, though my score was lower due to facing financial challenges and working in a factory to resolve them. This experience         demonstrated my ability to quickly learn and adapt despite difficult circumstances.
4. üí° I taught myself web development from online courses and am currently working on my first mega project, **ShopEase**. This project is an E-commerce platform where students can buy and sell items. 
       If you‚Äôre interested in contributing to this project, feel free to reach out and join in! Your contributions are welcome and appreciated.
